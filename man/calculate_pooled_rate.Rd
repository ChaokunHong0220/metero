or "PFT" (proportion Freeman-Tukey)}

\item{min_studies}{Minimum number of studies required for pooling}

A list with the meta-analysis results
}
\description{
Performs meta-analysis to calculate pooled (combined) resistance rates
across multiple studies, with options for stratification and different
meta-analytic methods.
