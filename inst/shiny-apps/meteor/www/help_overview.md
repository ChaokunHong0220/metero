# METEOR Help - Overview

## What is METEOR?

METEOR (Antimicrobial Resistance Meta-analysis and Integrated Analysis Toolkit) is an R package for analyzing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for importing, standardizing, analyzing, and visualizing AMR data.

## Key Features

METEOR offers the following main features:

- **Data Import and Management**: Import AMR data from CSV, Excel, or R data files and standardize it into a unified format
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Check data completeness and quality, identifying potential issues
- **Meta-Analysis**: Calculate pooled resistance rates, assess heterogeneity, perform subgroup analyses
- **Data Visualization**: Create geographic maps, forest plots, heatmaps, and trend plots
- **Report Generation**: Generate standardized reports for research or policy-making purposes

## Getting Started

1. First, import your AMR data (via the "Data Import" tab)
2. Browse your data and check data quality (via the "Data Overview" tab)
3. Perform analyses (via the "Analysis" tab)
4. Create visualizations (via the "Visualization" tab)
5. Generate reports (via the "Reports" tab)

## South Asia Focus

METEOR provides special support for analyzing AMR data from South Asia. In the geographic visualization, you can select "South Asia" as a specific map region to better focus on AMR patterns in this area. South Asian countries include: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives, and Afghanistan.
