# Visualization Help

metero provides several visualization tools to help you explore and present AMR data.

## Geographic Maps

**Geographic maps** display resistance rates across different countries or regions, using color gradients to show resistance levels.

### Options:

- **Map Region**: Choose the region to display ("World" or "South Asia")
- **Color Scheme**: Choose the color scheme for representing resistance rates

Geographic maps are especially useful for:
- Identifying geographic hotspots of high resistance
- Comparing differences between regions
- Visualizing patterns in specific regions such as South Asia

## Forest Plots

**Forest plots** graphically present meta-analysis results, showing effect estimates for individual studies and the pooled effect.

### Options:

- **Sort by Effect Size**: Sort studies by resistance rate
- **Maximum Studies**: Limit the number of studies displayed

Forest plots are especially useful for:
- Displaying resistance rates and confidence intervals across multiple studies
- Visualizing heterogeneity between studies
- Showing pooled resistance rates and overall effects

## Resistance Heatmaps

**Resistance heatmaps** use a matrix of color intensities to display resistance rates for different pathogen-antibiotic combinations.

### Options:

- **Cluster by Rows**: Choose whether to cluster rows (typically pathogens)
- **Cluster by Columns**: Choose whether to cluster columns (typically antibiotics)

Heatmaps are especially useful for:
- Identifying patterns of resistance
- Comparing resistance across multiple pathogens and antibiotics
- Discovering potential cross-resistance

## Trend Plots

**Trend plots** show changes in resistance rates over time.

### Options:

- **Time Variable**: Choose the time variable for the X-axis (typically year)
- **Group By**: Choose the variable to group by (pathogen, antibiotic, or country)
- **Smoothing Method**: Choose the method for smoothing trend lines (None, LOESS, or Linear)

Trend plots are especially useful for:
- Tracking changes in resistance over time
- Predicting future trends
- Comparing temporal patterns across different pathogens or antibiotics

## Generating and Downloading Visualizations

1. Select the visualization type
2. Set the appropriate options

## South Asia Region Visualization

For South Asia region visualization, metero provides a specialized map option. When you select "Map Region" as "South Asia", it will display a map focused on India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives, and Afghanistan, allowing you to examine AMR patterns in this region in more detail.
